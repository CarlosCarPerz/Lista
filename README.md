<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This GitHub repository is an exercise in Oracle Next Education(ONE). The purpose is to create a check list that can list tasks to be done and be able to mark when they are done as well as be able to delete them. A layout provided by Alura was used, however I tried to do some CSS modifications to make it more personal. In addition to making the design respond to different screen sizes and prevent it from creating empty tasks.
